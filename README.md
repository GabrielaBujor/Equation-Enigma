Equation Enigma is an Android application designed to help high school students simplify complex mathematical functions. By breaking down functions into manageable sections, the application assists students in understanding and solving mathematical problems, particularly focusing on functions, to prepare them for end-of-school exams.

**Features**
1) **Interactive Lessons**: Provides both solved and unsolved exercises on mathematical functions such as Power, Root, Logarithmic, and Exponential functions.
2) **Graphical Representation**: Visualizes functions using graphs, helping students understand concepts like function behaviour and graph intersections.
3) **Quizzes**: Offers quizzes that test studentsâ€™ understanding, providing instant feedback and saving reports for review.
4) **User Profiles**: Both students and teachers can create profiles. Teachers can view students' quiz performance reports to track progress.
5) **Firebase Integration**: User data, lessons, quizzes, and reports are stored and managed securely using Google Firebase.

**Technologies Used**
1) **Android Studio**: The application is built using Android Studio with Java as the primary language.
2) **Google Firebase**: Firebase Authentication for secure user login, Firestore for storing user data and educational content, and Firebase Storage for managing profile pictures and graphs.
3) **GeoGebra**: Used for generating the graphical representation of functions, integrated into the application.

**Future Improvements**
Add more functions and equations to cover a wider range of mathematical topics.
Implement badges and rewards to increase student engagement.
Expand the quiz functionality with more challenging problems and additional assessment methods.
